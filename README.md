README - COOL CAR, BRO ðŸš—

Project Description:

"Cool Car, Bro" is a fun and interactive game where you drive a car along the road, encountering various random events and characters. Your goal is to increase the "coolness" factor of your car, which is affected by the actions you take along the way.

As you drive, you will come across different items and characters. Some will increase the coolness of your car, while others may decrease it. One of the key elements of the game is meeting a friend (kompis) along the road who you must greet correctly in one of three possible ways. The correct greeting changes each time you meet a new kompis, and your coolness level will influence the type of greeting you receive in return.

In addition, you may face challenges such as avoiding aggressive grandmothers or encountering random events that either help or hinder your journey to fill your coolness meter.


How to Play:
Drive the car along the road.
Make choices when encountering random events or characters.
Increase your coolness by choosing items that improve your car's coolness factor.
Meet your kompis and greet him in the correct way. If you're successful, your coolness increases, and you receive a cool response. If you fail, you'll receive a less cool response, and your coolness may decrease.
Avoid negative events like the angry grandmother, who can lower your coolness if you're not careful.
Fill your coolness meter to win the game. If you reach a high level of coolness, you may face a boss battle after crossing paths with several squirrels (this part of the game can be added later).
Features:
Random events: Items or characters will appear randomly, giving the player different choices that affect their coolness.
Dynamic greetings: You must figure out the correct way to greet your kompis each time you meet him. If you greet him incorrectly, your coolness may decrease.
Coolness meter: The main goal of the game is to fill the coolness meter completely.
Events like the aggressive grandmother or other random surprises that can impact your coolness in fun ways.
Interactive choices that make each playthrough unique.
Technologies Used:
JavaScript (to implement game logic)
HTML/CSS (for the basic user interface)
GitHub Collaboration (to manage and work on the code together)
Structure:
This game follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern:


Model: This part handles the data and game logic, such as the current coolness level, random events, and choices.
View: The view represents the user interface where players interact with the game, see their coolness meter, and choose actions.
Controller: The controller processes the user's input, updates the model, and renders the appropriate view.
Installation:
Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/cool-car-bro.gi](https://szczepanskimichal.github.io/fellesoppgave3/)t

Plan:
First, we'll focus on implementing the core game logic, including the random events, coolness meter, and the kompis greeting system.
After the game logic is in place, we'll begin designing the user interface using HTML and CSS.
Finally, we'll refine the game, add extra features like the boss battle and squirrel challenge, and polish the user interface.
